/*
    Taking into consideration the moment the kicker contacts the ball, the distance you are from
the goal, and the current speed and acceleration rate of the grabber wheels, potentially
the movement patterns of the robot itself,
We can adjust the wheels rotate in such a way where it increases or decreases
the resistance on the ball, increasing or decreasing the distance the ball can go
into the goal from.
